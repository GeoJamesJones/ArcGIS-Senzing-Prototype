# ArcGIS - Senzing sample integration toolbox

This project was built using ArcGIS Pro Intelligence 2.8 and the latest Senzing build via the ongoing business relationship between the two companies.

To get started, clone this repo to your local drive in a place that ArcGIS Pro Intelligence has access and copy the necessary DLLs and data from senzing to their respective folders.  For instance, the libpostal data will be copied to the senzing\g2\data folder and the DLLs will need to be copied to the senzing\g2\lib folder. 

Once that is done, open the Python toolbox from within ArcGIS Pro Intelligence, and you can begin to play around.
